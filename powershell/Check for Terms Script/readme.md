This is a script that I created to take import a spreadsheet that contained usernames from a SaaS application (Adobe, LucidChart, DocuSign etc) and compare it to a list of users grabbed from Azure Active Directory/Entra ID and then return the users who are deactivated and can have their license removed. Used to assist in license management when automatic management via Okta did not work.
