This is a script I wrote to automate the creation of new user accounts in Active Directory and their respective group memberships based on their department and/or other attributes. A different version of this script was used in production at my organization to automate the AD user creation process. The one in this repository is a sanitized/alternate version that I tested and ran in my lab environment.
